# Race Around the Netherlands - research questions

## Introduction
Every year a bunch of cycling-fanatics set of to Race Around the Netherlands. This is a 1.913km long race with 4.164m elevation starting and ending in Amerongen (Utrecht). The route is predetermined, the rest is up to the riders. They have 9 days to finish the ride.
The race is not as much a race against competitors, as it is a race against the elements and well, quite frankly, a very painful backside.
Detailed race-data is available for the 2018-2021 editions, which will be the topic of this project.

## Research questions
#### THE WEATHER
1). The race is held in spring, and Dutch springs can be very capracious. Headwind, rain and low temperatures (especially wind chill – gevoelstemperatuur) can slow you down and lower morale. Though wind can work to your advantage and disadvantage and really depends on what way you are cycling. As some stretches are U-shaped, for the wind analyses, I therefore look at a few very windy, and quite straight part of the route: the stretch from Groningen to Harlingen and Harlingen to Amsterdam. West and in the Second part South Western winds are very unfavourable in this stretch. Let’s see how different winds (directions&speed) affect the time riders need to cover these parts of the route.  
2). Apart from the wind, rain and low temperatures can also affect the riders. Let’s look at the average rainfall and temperature for each edition, and see if lower temperatures and more rainfall makes riders give up more often and/or more quickly (earlier in the route). 

#### MEN VERSUS WOMEN
3). Both men and women ride the same route. Women usually ride slower, which means: more days in the saddle. How many more days do women need on average?
4). Men may be faster than women, but who are tougher? What is the average DNF rate of men versus women, and at which point do they give up? 

#### THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS?
5). There are two categories: solo cyclists and duo’s. You’d think that duo’s would be back quicker: you an keep up each others morale, and draft (which is forbidden for the solo riders). But does it work this way? Let’s look at the couples: do mixed sex couples on average finish before female solo riders? And how about the male-couples?

#### IS EXPERIENCE EVERYTHING?
6). If enough overlap in participants: Do recurring riders get better? 
7). If age is provided: Experience can prepare you for challenges as above. Does age affect how likely you are to finish? (% DNF)

## Data needed
#### THE ROUTE
- The RATN route (GPX-files); 
- Locations of the checkpoints;

#### PARTICIPANT INFORMATION
- First & last name;
- Gender;
- Solo- or pair-rider;
- Checkpoint-timings; 
- Age (if available)

#### WEATHER STATS 
stats of different weather stations around the Netherlands: 
- Windspeed;
- Wind direction; 
- Avg daily temperatures;
- Daily rainfall; 


#### LOCATION OF WEATHER STATIONS ALONG THE ROUTE
The weather station for each stretch is chosen so the station is more or less half way between the start and end of the stretch;
